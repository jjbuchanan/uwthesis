\setabstract{%
  This thesis presents several studies of monophoton final states
  using 35.9\fbinv\ of 13\unit{TeV} proton--proton collision data collected by the CMS
  experiment at the LHC in 2016. The standard model \zinvg\ cross section is measured
  as a function of photon transverse momentum. No significant deviations from standard
  model predictions are observed.
  The results are also interpreted in the context of several new physics models.
  Limits are placed on new particle masses in simplified models of dark matter,
  the suppression scale of a dark matter effective field theory model,
  and the graviton mass scale in a model of extra spatial dimensions.
