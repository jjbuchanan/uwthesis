\subsubsection{Prefit yields}
Tables~\ref{tab:BkgSummary_above0p5_prefit}, \ref{tab:BkgSummary_below0p5_prefit}, \ref{tab:BkgSummaryMonoel_prefit},
and \ref{tab:BkgSummaryMonomu_prefit} show the prefit expected yields and uncertainties from each process in the vertical signal region,
horizontal signal region, single electron control region, and single muon control region, respectively. The process "Z$\nu\nu$G:out" refers
to \zinvg\ events with either true \pTgamma\ less than 175\unit{GeV}, dineutrino \pT\ less than 170\unit{GeV}, or photon $|\eta| > 1.4442$. Such events are
in all cases treated as a source of background, and we do not attempt to measure their cross section. The prefit normalization of the beam halo yield is
estimated using a timing template fit similar to the one used for spikes, and is
intended here only to highlight the relative proportions of beam halo in the horizontal and vertical signal regions; the postfit normalization
ends up being very close to zero in all cases.

In these tables, processes with freely-floating normalization parameters
are not assigned a prefit uncertainty on those parameters, but they may have a prefit uncertainty on their reconstructed \ETgamma\ shape
and/or the transfer factors linking them to other regions. For this reason, the specific values of the prefit uncertainties
depend the specific likelihood function being used. The first four tables show the prefit estimates in the signal regions and single-lepton control regions
corresponding to the SM \zinvg\ cross section measurement.
To compare these uncertainties to those on the prefit plots shown in the previous section,
incorporate extra uncorrelated uncertainties on \zinvg\ and \wlng\ corresponding to their theoretical cross section uncertainties.
The remaining tables show the prefit estimates in every region corresponding to the DM search. The uncertainties on \wlng\ are noticeably larger in these
tables due to the incorporation of the \zinvg/\wlng\ transfer factor uncertainty.

    \caption{Summary of estimated prefit yields in the dielectron control region for the SM \zinvg\ cross section measurement.
    Each column corresponds to a single bin in reconstructed \ETgamma. Processes with freely-floating normalization parameters
    are not assigned a prefit error on those parameters, but may have a prefit error on their reconstructed \ETgamma\ shape
    and/or the transfer factors linking them to other regions.}
